# War Game
## Game Rules:
The card game Three Card War is a simple card game for two players. The game 
uses a 52 card conventional deck. To begin the deck is shufed and each player 
draws three cards. The players may look at their three cards. The remaining cards are
placed in a pile facedown between the two players. The players decide who is going 
frst. 
* The player going frst selects one of his three cards and places it face up. 
* The opposing player selects one of her three cards and places it face up. 
* If the ranks of both cards are the same (a push), then both players retain their 
cards and set them aside. Otherwise, the player with the highest-ranking card 
keeps both cards (again, setting them aside). 
* After playing the round, each player draws one card from the deck to replace 
the card just played with the frst playing drawing frst. 
* The player that won the round is now the frst player for the next round unless 
there was a push then the original frst player goes frst again. 
* The game ends when the deck is exhausted and both players have played all of
their three cards. 
* The player with the most cards set aside wins.  

Card ranking begins with the 2 as the lowest card going up to the ten, then jack, 
queen, king, and ace.
